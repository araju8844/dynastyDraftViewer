# dynastyDraftViewer
using the Sleeper Fantasy API for a Sleeper Fantasy League to show highlights of players drafted as they are drafted, so it feels more like an NFL Draft.
Here is a link to the Sleeper API: https://docs.sleeper.app/
We use this to get information from our league in the form of JSON (Think of it as just a set of data)

With the Sleeper API we will query for the draft info, and when a new player gets drafted, we will search for a youtube video of their highlights using some form of Youtube API and play that video
Here is an example of how to do so: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26046567/youtube-api-get-a-video
